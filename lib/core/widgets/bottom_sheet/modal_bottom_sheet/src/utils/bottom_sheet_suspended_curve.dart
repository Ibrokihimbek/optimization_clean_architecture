/// A curve that progresses linearly until a specified [startingPoint], at which
/// point [curve] will begin. Unlike [Interval], [curve] will not start at zero,
/// but will use [startingPoint] as the Y position.
///
/// For example, if [startingPoint] is set to `0.5`, and [curve] is set to
/// [Curves.easeOut], then the bottom-left quarter of the curve will be a
/// straight line, and the top-right quarter will contain the entire contents of
/// [Curves.easeOut].
///
/// This is useful in situations where a widget must track the user's finger
/// (which requires a linear animation), and afterwards can be flung using a
/// curve specified with the [curve] argument, after the finger is released. In
/// such a case, the value of [startingPoint] would be the progress of the
/// animation at the time when the finger was released.
///
/// The [startingPoint] and [curve] arguments must not be null.
